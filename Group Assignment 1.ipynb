    "The AmEx Credit Default Prediction challenge was a competition to predict the probability that a customer does not pay back their credit card balance amount in the future based on their monthly customer profile. The target binary variable is calculated by observing 18 months performance window after the latest credit card statement, and if the customer does not pay due amount in 120 days after their latest statement date it is considered a default event.\n",

    "In this assignment, you will tackle this challenge using some deep learning models. You will:\n",
    "- Train a neural network using Keras\n",
    "- Understand ERM via loss functions and metrics\n",
    "- Explore learning rates\n",
    "- Implement a cost-sensitive loss\n",
    "- Evaluate business cost via thresholding"

    "When using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the learning rate is the most critical hyperparameter because it controls the size of the steps the model takes toward the minimum of the loss function. In the results, the learning rate of **0.001** is too conservative. While the loss curve is very smooth and stable, indicating that the model is consistently moving in the right direction, the descent is slow that it remains far from the optimal solution after 20 epochs. This creates a risk of underfitting if the training budget is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate of **0.01** shows a much healthier balance for a standard training run. It achieves a significantly lower validation loss much faster than the smaller rate while maintaining perfect stability. This rate allows the model to capture the general trend of the data without being distracted by noise. However, looking at the graph, it still hasn't quite reached the plateau that the higher rates achieved, suggesting it could still benefit from more training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **0.1**, we see the most efficient convergence. The model reaches its floor almost immediately, within the first 2.5 to 5 epochs. While there are some very slight ripples in the validation loss, they are negligible compared to the speed gains. In most practical scenarios, this would be considered the ideal rate among our choices because it maximizes the utility of each epoch and reaches a high-performing state quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the learning rate of **1.0** illustrates the danger of setting the rate too high. Although it hits a low loss value instantly, the red line is characterized by jagged oscillations. Because the steps are large, the optimizer is likely overshooting the actual minimum, jumping from one side to the other without settling at the bottom. This lack of stability can prevent the model from reaching the best weights and can sometimes lead to the loss exploding entirely if the rate were any higher."

    "# Question 1:\n",
    "# The learning rate dictates the step size the optimizer takes toward the minimum loss. A very small rate (like 0.001) results in stable but slow convergence that may underfit, while a very high rate (like 1.0) can cause the model to overshoot the minimum, leading to unstable oscillations or failure to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2a:\n",
    "# Beyond adjusting the learning rate, ensuring that the input features were properly normalized through scaling was a key factor in improving performance. We also observed that increasing the number of training epochs allowed the slower learning rates to eventually reach a higher accuracy level that they couldn't achieve in a shorter run.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2b:\n",
    "# Feature scaling is highly effective because it prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating the gradient updates, creating a more uniform loss surface that SGD can navigate more directly. Additionally, giving the model more time to train (more epochs) is necessary for smaller learning rates because they take small steps. Without enough iterations, they simply stop before reaching the optimal weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3:\n",
    "# Accuracy treats all misclassifications as equal, but in banking, the financial impact of a false negative (missing a default) is ten times higher than a false positive (denying a good loan). A cost-sensitive loss forces the model to prioritize avoiding the most expensive mistakes, ultimately minimizing the total financial loss rather than just maximizing the percentage of correct guesses.\n",
